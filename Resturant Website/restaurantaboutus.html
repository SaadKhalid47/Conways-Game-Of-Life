    <h3 style="color:#FEFEFE">Hi my name is Giovanni Francesco and I was born in Rome, Italy. A few years ago I realized that I was a celiac. Celiac disease, sometimes called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. However whenever I went to eat out with friends and family, it was difficult to find gluten free meals and goods. As a result I decided to make my own gluten free restaurant that sticks to my Italian roots. As my grandma used to say "italian food is all about ingredients and it's not fussy and its not fancy." Thats why we bake fresh food everyday and only use the highest quality of ingredients from local farmers. Mozzafiato is an italian name for breathtaking and this is what we want you to feel when you enter our restaurant.</h3>

We take the health and saftey of our customers very seriously and do not cross contaminate. We are proud to have won numerous awards and have one the trip advisor award for best restaurant in Calgary.</h3>

    <h3 style="color:#FEFEFE; width: 22%; height: 50%; position: absolute;left: 5%;top: 130%">  Adam Aamann is the host of the Italian national food TV-show Fiasco, a food consultant to other successful restaurateurs, author of several cookbooks, the owner of Aamann’s Establishment – a lunch diner with a more bodega-like feel, a jam-packed Aamann’s CPH Airport and an 80,00 square feet event and conference facility, which has hosted everything from fashion shows and product launches to weddings and large company parties.  </h3>
    <h3 style="color:#FEFEFE; width: 22%; height: 50%; position: absolute;left: 40%;top: 130%"> Born in Leipzig, Daniel Achilles is driven by the unconditional desire to always present something new to his guests. This does not necessarily have to be a particular produce, but the way it is prepared or presented. There may certainly be times when the celebrity chef makes his own utensils and prefers using a nicely shaped branch of a walnut tree for the presentation of an amuse-bouche instead of a plate.  </h3>
          <h3 style="color:#FEFEFE; width: 22%; height: 50%; position: absolute;left: 75%;top: 130%"> Chef Juliete Soulé has a degree in Gastronomy from Universidade Anhembi Morumbi and has been working in the pastry business for 10 years. He has extensive experience in high confectionery, acquired through work carried out in the hotels Club Med Trancoso, Hotel Renaissance, Hotel Emiliano and Palácio Tangará. She deepened her chocolate techniques by working at Barry Callebaut with renowned national and international chefs. </h3>
